✅ Correct NX + Next.js structure (recommended)
Your web app should look like:

web/
  app/                 <--- Next.js routes + layouts
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
    login/
      page.tsx
    dashboard/
      layout.tsx
      page.tsx
  public/
  src/
    components/        <--- UI components
    lib/               <--- reusable utilities, helpers, axios client
    hooks/
  styles/
  project.json
🚀 What goes where (simple rules)
✔️ Everything Next.js routing-related
→ Goes in web/app

Example:

web/app/dashboard/page.tsx
web/app/dashboard/layout.tsx
web/app/login/page.tsx
web/app/api/...   (optional Next.js API routes)
✔️ Everything reusable (UI components, helpers, services)
→ Goes in web/src

Example:

web/src/components/AuthForm.tsx
web/src/lib/api.ts
web/src/hooks/useSomething.ts
✔️ Everything backend-related
→ Goes in api/

That folder is good.

⭐ Where should your AuthProvider go?
Because AuthProvider interacts with routing (redirects), put it under:

web/app/providers/AuthProvider.tsx
This is absolutely correct.

Your AuthForm should stay under:

web/src/components/AuthForm.tsx
🧹 Clean-up you should do
❗ Delete or rename /web/src/app/
Or move its contents to the correct location:

web/src/components/
web/src/lib/
web/app/
You should end up with:

web/
  app/
    ...
  src/
    components/
    lib/
⭐ Best Practice for NX Monorepos (you’re almost there)
Backend (NestJS)
api/
  src/
    users/
    auth/
    prisma/
This is already good.

Frontend (Next.js)
web/
  app/              <-- routing
  src/
    components/     <-- reusable UI
    lib/            <-- axios, helpers
    hooks/
  public/
Shared Code (optional, recommended)
If later you need shared types or utilities across apps, move them to libs:

libs/
  types/
  utils/
  interfaces/
👍 Summary
Folder	Good?	Notes
api/*	✔️	Proper NestJS app
web/app	✔️	Correct App Router
web/src/components	✔️	Good location
web/src/lib	✔️	Good location
web/src/app	❌	Must be removed or reorganized
Fixing the /src/app conflict will make your project clean and aligned with best practices.

If you want, I can:

✅ Suggest a fully reorganized folder structure
✅ Move your AuthProvider, AuthForm, and related files to the right places
✅ Help set up NX shared libraries (libs/*)
✅ Create a clean web/app folder for routes and layouts

You said:
why public folder outside app, what it has
ChatGPT said:
Great question — and this one is important for understanding how Next.js handles static assets.

Let’s make it very clear:

⭐ Why the public/ folder is outside the app/ folder
Because public/ is not part of routing, and not controlled by the App Router.

It is a static asset folder that Next.js exposes directly at the root URL (/).

So:

/public/logo.png
is served at:

https://your-website.com/logo.png
regardless of what’s inside the app/ folder.

🗂️ What goes in public/?
Everything that:

✔️ must be publicly accessible
✔️ should NOT be bundled by Webpack or Vite
✔️ should NOT be imported directly into components
✔️ should not trigger Next.js transformations
Typical examples:

1️⃣ Images
Logos, backgrounds, icons, OpenGraph images:

public/logo.png
public/bg.jpg
public/icons/user.svg
2️⃣ Static files
public/robots.txt
public/sitemap.xml
public/manifest.json
3️⃣ Downloadable files
public/files/terms.pdf
public/files/app.apk
4️⃣ Favicons
public/favicon.ico
public/apple-touch-icon.png
public/icon.png
⭐ Why isn't public/ inside the app/ folder?
Because:

It must be at the root of the Next.js app folder

Next.js needs it at build time

Assets inside public are not processed by the bundler

App Router folders (app/) are for routes and components, not static assets

So Next.js architecture is:

web/
  app/        <-- pages, layouts, components
  public/     <-- static files, not compiled
  src/        <-- reusable code
The App Router has nothing to do with public/.

⭐ When should you put images in public/?
Use public/ when:

✔️ You need a file to be available at a public URL
Example: OG images:

<meta property="og:image" content="/og-image.png" />
✔️ You use the <Image> component with a fixed file path
<Image src="/logo.png" width={100} height={50} />
✔️ You don’t want bundling or hashing
Assets stay exactly as-is.

✔️ You need stable URLs for crawlers or external access
(e.g., robots.txt, favicon.ico)

❌ When not to use public/?
Do NOT put component-specific images in public.

Better:

import MyImg from '@/assets/foo.png'
or with /app/:

<Image src="/images/foo.png" />
🧠 Summary Table
Folder	Purpose	Managed by	Behaves like
app/	Routes, layouts, server & client components	Next.js App Router	React + routing
src/	Reusable code, UI components, hooks	Webpack/Vite	Normal code
public/	Raw static assets (images, txt, xml)	Node/static server	Static files
🎉 Final answer
The public folder is outside app/ because it contains static assets, not routes.
Next.js serves everything in public/ as raw files at the root URL, completely separate from routing logic.
